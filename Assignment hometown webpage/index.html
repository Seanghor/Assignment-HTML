                    Siem Reap is one of those places that caters to every taste. It’s difficult to get bored in this ever-evolving city. The variety of cuisine, accommodation, shopping, modes of transport, and daily activities is quite astonishing for what is actually a relatively small – and new – city on the edge of the Tonle Sap lake.
                    The central highlight is of course the Temples of Angkor – most of which are just a short trip from the center of town. However, it would be a mistake to see Siem Reap as merely a bed for the night to allow for days at Angkor Wat. Whether it’s enjoy sipping a coffee and people-watching in the town, taking a quad bike out into the countryside, or bargaining for silks and silver in the burgeoning markets, there are plenty of reasons to extend a stay after becoming “templed out”.

                            <mark>Prahok ktiss</mark> is a traditional condiment in Siem Reap which uses fermented fish paste as its main ingredient. While most prahok-based dishes have a very strong, pungent flavour, this dipping sauce is palatable to most visitors thanks to the addition of sliced pork belly or minced pork, eggplant, coconut milk, and kroeung (Khmer curry paste).
                            Served with plenty of freshly sliced vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, cucumber, and long beans, prahok ktiss is typically enjoyed as a snack or side dish to noodles or rice.

                            Phnom Kulen is a place where Cambodians go to relax and play. In Cambodian culture most people dress conservatively even whilst swimming, so girls – keep to shorts and t-shirts, boys too – or if you must, at least shorts. No bikinis or speedos please!
                            When entering temples, be sure to remove your shoes and hats. It’s important to wear clothing that covers you from shoulders to knees. If you are not dressed accordingly, then it would be polite not to enter any of the temples.

                            The Bayon Temple is important because it allows us to better understand the beliefs, value and power of the Khmer Empire. The temple was built in the exact center of Angkor Thom, which translates to “Great City,” signifying its connection with heaven and earth
